## What is quizanga
Quizanga is simple trivia/quiz app. With this simple app user gets question for each turn as well as keeps track of participants points and add points to the player if question was answered correctly and remove points if the answer was wrong. I came up with this project because I wanted to implement API calls for the first time as well as I wanted to do more testable app, my first approach in making this app was TDD although it didn't worked out very well so I just tried to make as much test coverage as possible.
