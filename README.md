# Quizanga

## What is quizanga
Quizanga is going to be a trivia quiz app which simplifies game nights. With this simple app user gets question for each turn as well as keeps track of participants points and add points to the player if question was answered correctly and perhaps remove points or do nothing if the answer was wrong. So that's main goal of this app. I consider also allowing online game or adding forehead game, depends on the free time I'll be able to put into it. 

## Why?
I came up with this project because I'm finished with my other projects for now. With quizanga I want to learn API calls as well as testing app with all kinds of tests. I will even try to put into usage TDD.
